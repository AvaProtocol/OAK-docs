# This workflow will build and push files to Amazon S3 bucket.
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
# 1. Setup S3 bucket
#    Replace the value of the `BUCKET_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with your S3 bucket name.
#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your S3 bucket's region.
# 2. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.
