[__OAK (On-chain Autonomous Kernel) Network__](https://oak.tech) is an automation blockchain for Defi and recurring payments across protocols. The blockchain is built on Parity Substrate with an event-driven execution model. Different from Ethereumâ€™s transaction-based model, where a transaction requires private key signing, OAK allows transactions to be triggered by event signals such as time, price, event triggers and smart contract state changes. 
 
OAK Network aims to be the No.1 utility Layer-2 across protocols, offering on-chain automation not possible today, such as [limit & stop-loss orders](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders) on Automated-Market-Making DEX and recurring payments. With OAK's on-chain finality and network security, it can empower any blockchain with its autonomous functionality, unleashing endless product potentials.

## Networks
The Polkadot ecosystem enables multiple types of networks: a testnet, canary and mainnet. Below are the different networks.
- *OAK Testnet*: standalone testnet (built off of substrate); soon to be deprecated
- *Neumann (NEU)*: testnet parachain; expect chaos and occassional downtime for the network; these tokens hold no value
- *Turing (TUR)*: Kusama parachain (coming soon); this is a canary, expect chaos but limited/no downtime; these tokens do hold value
- *OAK*: Polkadot parachain (coming soon); this is the mainnet
