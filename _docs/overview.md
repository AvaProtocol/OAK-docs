[__OAK (On-chain Autonomous Kernel) Network__](https://oak.tech) is an automation layer-2 blockchain for Defi and recurring payments. Our mission is to build a Stripe for Web 3.0 across protocols. The blockchain is built on Parity Substrate with an event-driven execution model. Different from Ethereumâ€™s transaction-based model, where a transaction requires private key signing, OAK allows transactions to be triggered by event signals such as time, price, and smart contract state changes. 
 
OAK Network aims to be the No.1 utility Layer-2 across protocols, offering on-chain automation not possible today, such as [limit & stop-loss orders](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders) on Automated-Market-Making DEX and recurring payments. With OAK's on-chain finality and network security, it can empower any blockchain with its autonomous functionality, unleashing endless product potentials.
