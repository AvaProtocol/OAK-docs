### General feedback
The best way to provide a general feedback is to leave a message on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oak_network), or chat with us in [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7W9UDvsbwh).

### For developers
We welcome all development effort to help build the OAK Network. As a developer, the best way to interact is to create an issue in any of OAK Network's [Github repo](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/).

Besides, our [Bug Bounty](../bug-bounty) program is always running and valid. For any issues found by community members, we will send reward in OAK tokens. Prior to OAK Network mainnet launch, the reward tokens will be kept in record and issue upon the network launch.
