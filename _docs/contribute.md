### General feedback
The best way to provide a general feedback is to leave a message on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oak_network), or chat with us in [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7W9UDvsbwh).

Currently there is no set program from general feedback rewarding, but we will reward great feedback and ideas in OAK tokens.

### Social influencers
If you are a social influencer and would like to spread the word for OAK Network, feel free to shoot us an email at <contact@oak.tech>. We will respond within 12 hours.

### Developers
We welcome all development effort to help build the OAK Network. As a developer, the best way to interact is to create an issue in any of OAK Network's [Github repo](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/).

Besides, our [Bug Bounty](../bug-bounty) program is always running and valid. For any issues found by community members, we will send reward in OAK tokens. 

> Note that, prior to OAK Network mainnet launch, the reward tokens will be kept in record and issue upon the network launch.
