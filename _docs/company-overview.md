[__Ava Protocol__](https://avaprotocol.org) is Web3’s hub for cross-chain automation, enabling multi-chain apps to schedule and automate any substrate extrinsic or EVM smart contract function. Ava Protocol is built to deliver trustless automation, dedicating its block space and optimizing gas to store, trigger, and execute transactions to connected blockchains. 

Ava Protocol’s automation combines off-chain data streams with event-driven execution to automatically execute any transaction or smart contract function. Cross-consensus messaging (XCM) enables Ava Protocol to not only automate transactions on Ava Protocol, but also on any connected blockchains without tokens or private keys ever touching Ava Protocol. Ava Protocol’s trustless automation unlocks rich user experiences including scheduled and recurring payments, stable-cost-averaging, stop loss orders, and automatically-compounding rewards for staking, liquidity pool participants, and money market deposits.

As a layer one blockchain, Ava Protocol provides automation infrastructure that enables decentralized applications to automate single or recurring transactions using a simple “if this” condition and “then that” transaction instruction.

## Mission
To enable seamless, trustless and secure automation for Web3.

## Vision
For the everyday consumer to take decentralized automation for granted.


## Technology
- Layer 1 powered by Substrate
- Decentralized, on-chain event listener and registry
- Cross-chain transaction execution via XCMP, EVM-compatible partners & bridges

## How we're different
### No more wrapped asset
Assets are supported by the chain and no longer needs to tie up with one smart contract.

### One-to-many distribution
Ava Protocol VM supports the capability of sending to multiple addresses with one transaction.

### Eliminate off-chain servers
Repetitive transactions can be triggered by on-chain event module.

### No private key custody
Set up once, and the transaction can be triggered on-chain, care-free.

### Chain-level security
Different from EVM smart contracts, many core utility functions are secured by the network.

### Native upgradability
Based on Substrate, Ava Protocol will constantly evolve with forkless runtime upgrade.

### Time-based guarantees for execution
Users can rest assured that their event will execute at a certain time with a specific margin.
