[__OAK (On-chain Autonomous Kernel) Network__](https://oak.tech) is an automation blockchain for Defi and recurring payments across protocols. The blockchain is built on Parity Substrate with an event-driven execution model. Different from Ethereumâ€™s transaction-based model, where a transaction requires private key signing, OAK allows transactions to be triggered by event signals such as time, price, event triggers and smart contract state changes. 
 
OAK Network aims to be the No.1 utility Layer-2 across protocols, offering on-chain automation not possible today, such as [limit & stop-loss orders](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders) on Automated-Market-Making DEX and recurring payments. With OAK's on-chain finality and network security, it can empower any blockchain with its autonomous functionality, unleashing endless product potentials.

## Mission
To make automation seamless, trustless and secure for consumers of all generations.

## Vision
For the everyday consumer to take decentralized automation for granted.

## Company Goals
1. As a Layer 1 (L1) automation blockchain, we are deploying an event-driven execution virtual machine.
2. This L1 core functionality will be used to create best-in-class consumer-friendly UX by working with partners to develop DApps.


## Technology
- Polkadot parachain built off of the cumulus framework
- Decentralized, on-chain event listener
- Cross-chain transaction execution (via XCMP & bridges)
