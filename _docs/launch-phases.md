## OAK Network Launch Phases
The OAK Network has a phased roll-out plan, with important milestones toward decentralization marking each phase. Keep up-to-date with the OAK's phased roll-out plan at by viewing the roadmap

### The PoA Launch
The Genesis block of the OAK Network will be launched on the 2nd quarter of 2022, as a Proof of Authority (PoA) network. Governance was restricted to the single Sudo (super-user) key, which was held by Web3 Foundation to issue the commands and upgrades necessary to complete the launch process. During this time, validators started joining the network and signaling their intention to participate in consensus.

### Nominated Proof of Stake
Once Web3 Foundation was confident in the stability of the network and there was a sufficient number of validator intentions, Web3 Foundation used Sudo — a superuser account with access to governance functions — to initiate the first validator election. Following this election, the network transitioned from PoA into its second phase, Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS).

### Governance
After the chain had been running well with the validator set, the Sudo key issued a runtime upgrade that enabled the suite of governance modules in OAK; namely, the modules to enable a Council, a Technical Committee, and public referenda.

### Removal of Sudo
The Sudo module was removed by a runtime upgrade, transitioning the governance of the chain into the hands of the token (OAK) holders.

From this point, the network has been entirely in the hands of the token holders and is no longer under control of any centralized authority.

### Balance Transfers
To enable balance transfers, the community made a public proposal for a runtime upgrade that lifted the restriction on balance transfers. Transfer functionality was subsequently enabled on OAK at block number N.
