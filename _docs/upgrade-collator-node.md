Please join the [OAK Discord](https://discord.gg/7W9UDvsbwh) server to be notified of new node versions. This will be announced in technical updates channels. If are not diligent about upgrading to the lastest node version, your node may stop producing blocks and you will likely get less rewards (if you are part of the candidate pool).

The steps below should only cause 3-5 minutes of downtime for your node, if done properly.

## How to upgrade your node

### Step 1: Get to your node
SSH to your target node, and make sure it's functioning properly by vetting Telemetry, and your monitoring/dashboards.

### Step 2: Get the new binary ready

#### Option 1: Grab a compiled binary from OAK's Github
If you are using Ubuntu (20.04+ LTS x64), you can run the binary compiled by OAK that can be found [here](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/releases/latest). You'll use this to run your collator on your node. To acquire a copy of this via command line, use the commands below.

```
latest_url=$(curl -Lsf -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/releases/latest/download/)
version=${latest_url##*/}
curl -L https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain/releases/download/$version/oak-collator -o oak-collator
```

#### Option 2: Compile the binary
If you are using another machine, or are struggling with errors from the above, you may need to compile the binary within your node. If you're running a different OS, please compile the binary first and follow the instructions in the OAK-blockchain [README](https://github.com/OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain#install-oak-blockchain). For example, for the v1.4.0 binary, you can run the following command on your node.

```
git clone git@github.com:OAK-Foundation/OAK-blockchain.git    
git checkout v1.4.0
```

Then build your executable.

```
cargo build --release --features turing-node
```

#### Option 3: Grab the latest image from Docker
*Note regarding Docker: while we do support Docker images, we generally do not recommend this option unless you're testing. Docker builds are less performant when running nodes than using the binary paths above.*

If you choose to run the collator via Docker, you can find the Docker repository linked in the helpful resources above. You can grab the latest image (tagged `latest`), or the specific version. Create a volume for your data and check that the volume exists by inspecting. The following commands help you to do so.

```
docker pull oaknetwork/turing:1.4.0
docker volume create turing-data
docker volume inspect turing-data
```

### Step 3: Replace your old binary

#### Options 1 & 2

Linux binaries can be safely replaced while running if you perform an `unlink()` before placing the new file:
1. Remove the existing binary (ie. `rm oak-collator`)
2. Move the new binary into position (ie. `mv /tmp/oak-collator /data/dir/oak-collator`)

If you are not comfortable replacing the running binary, you can stop the service (ie. `systemctl stop oak-collator`) and follow the same steps.

#### Option 3

```bash
docker pull oaknetwork/turing:1.4.0
```

### Step 4: Restart your service

#### Options 1 & 2
Restart the `oak-collator` service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart oak-collator
```

#### Option 3

```bash
docker stop EXISTING_CONTAINER_ID
docker run -d -p 30333:30333 -p 9944:9944 -p 9933:9933  -v turing-data:/data
oaknetwork/turing:1.4.0 \
  --name=YOUR_COLLATOR_NAME \
  --base-path=/data \
  --chain=turing \
  --node-key=NODE_KEY \
  --collator \
  --force-authoring \
  --execution=wasm \
  --state-cache-size=0 \
  -- \
  --execution=wasm \
  --no-telemetry
```

### Step 5: Monitor your node
Please make sure to monitor your node for a few minutes to ensure that it continues to produce blocks.
