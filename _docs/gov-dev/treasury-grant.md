## Grant Treasury funds to community developers

*Pre-requisite: Before reading this article, you should be familiar with [how to submit a proposal](/docs/gov-dev/governance-via-polkadotjs/#introduction).*

We need to submit a proposal on the Treasury page first, and then council members can vote on the council.

The Treasury's proposal can be approved by the council and does not need to be voted on by a referendum.

Treasury proposal is a way to allocate treasury funds within Council, and there are other ways: Tips, Bounties.

Tips allows anyone to submit a tip proposal, and Council members suggest how much to distribute.

Bounties is to carry out a job and entrust an agent to allocate funds according to the progress of the job completion.
