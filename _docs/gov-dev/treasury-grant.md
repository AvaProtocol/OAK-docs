## Grant Treasury funds to community developers

We need to submit a proposal on the Treasury interface first, and then council members can vote on the council.

The Treasury's proposal can be approved by the council and does not need to be voted on by a referendum.

Treasury proposal is a way to allocate treasury funds within Council, and there are other ways: Tips, Bounties.

Tips allows anyone to submit a tip proposal, and Council members suggest how much to distribute.

Bounties is to carry out a job and entrust an agent to allocate funds according to the progress of the job completion.

## Update chain configuration through Governance

Similar steps as aboveï¼š

1\. Submit a preimage. 

2\. Submit a normal proposal or external proposal.

3\. If the external proposal needs urgent processing, the technical committee can use the "fast track" to process it.

4\. conduct a referendum.

5\. When the voting period ends, the vote will be executed at the end of the enactment period.
