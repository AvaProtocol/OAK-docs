We have set up an automatic process for test token dispensing via Discord Bot. 100 OAK test tokens can be retrieved by each Discord user every 24 hours. Hereâ€™s the how.

1. Join our Discord Server.
1. Navigate to the #oak-testnet-faucet channel.
1. Enter below text in the channel to receive token with a wallet address.
    ```
    !drip <OAK_testnet_address>
    ```
    for example,
    ```
    !drip 5DX3e6rFJS5T23Wh1dnuqoB4rrMCXf4KxGchSbFmJytVVaSR
    ```
    Besides, if you want to view more options for the Discord Bot, type
    ```bash
    !faucet
    ```
Note that each Discord user or target wallet address can only `!drip` once every 24 hours. If you need more testnet tokens please reach out to us through [Contact Us](../contact-us).
