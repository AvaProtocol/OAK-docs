The Polkadot ecosystem enables multiple types of networks: a testnet, canary and mainnet. Below are the different networks.
- *OAK Testnet*: standalone testnet (built off of substrate); soon to be deprecated
- *Turing Staging (TUR)*: testnet parachain; expect chaos and occassional downtime for the network; these tokens hold no value
- *Turing (TUR)*: Kusama parachain (coming soon); this is a canary, expect chaos but limited/no downtime; these tokens do hold value
- *OAK*: Polkadot parachain (coming soon); this is the mainnet
