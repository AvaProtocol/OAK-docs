# Tutorial
## Get your wallet address
The wallet address on Turing Staging is the same as that on Turing Network, because they both use `ss58 prefix: 51` to format an address.

1. Navigate to the [Turing Staging PolkadotJS App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.turing-staging.oak.tech%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer)
   
2. Go to the Accounts > Accounts tab
   
3. Copy the address of your selected wallet.
