Compared to the incumbent, OAK Network is built in a way that it's fundamentally different from today's norm of blockchains. We are looking far ahead in the future and creating a cutting-edge blockchain for the next three to five years. The core features and advantages include,

### No more wrapped asset
Assets are supported by the chain and no longer needs to tie up with one smart contract.

### One-to-many distribution
OAK VM supports the capability of sending to multiple addresses with one transaction.

### Eliminate off-chain servers
Repetitive transactions can be triggered by on-chain event module.

### No private key custody
Set up once, and the transaction can be triggered on-chain, care-free.

### Chain-level security
Different from EVM smart contracts, many core utility functions are secured by the network.

### Native upgradability
Based on Substrate, OAK Network will constantly evolve with on-chain runtime upgrade.
