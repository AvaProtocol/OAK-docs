This guide provides links and instructions for staking by delegating an existing Turing Network collator. See [Collator Overview](https://avaprotocol.org/docs/collators/) for instructions on setting up your own collator.

_Please exercise caution when following links to external resources that are not maintained or tested by the Ava Protocol team!_

## Which wallet are you using?

### Polkadot JS ([Extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.turing.oak.tech#/extrinsics))
Keep scrolling in this document or visit one the following guides created by members of the Ava Protocol community:

- Video tutorial is available in [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDryLlbQs8g).
- [Turing Staking Guide](https://oak-turing.pathrocknetwork.org) by pathrocknetwork, one of Turing Network's node operators.

### Which collator will you delegate your stake to?

[StakeTur](https://staketur.com) by StakeBaby, staking applications, and wallet interfaces with staking support will provide additional information that can help you choose who to delegate. Join the #collator-open-chat channel of [Ava Protocol Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7W9UDvsbwh) to ask questions to collators.

**Important disclaimer about risks**

_Holders of TUR tokens should perform careful due diligence on collators before delegating. Being listed as a collator is not an endorsement or recommendation from the Turing Network, or Ava Protocol. Neither the Turing Network, nor has Ava Protocol vetted the list collators and assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, security, accuracy, or use of any third-party offerings. You alone are responsible for doing your own diligence to understand the applicable fees and all risks present, including actively monitoring the activity of your collators._

_You agree and understand that neither the Turing Network, nor Ava Protocol guarantees that you will receive staking rewards and any applicable percentage provided (i) is an estimate only and not guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards you receive. The Ava Protocol makes no representations as to the monetary value of any rewards at any time._

_Staking TUR tokens is not free of risk. Staked TUR tokens are locked up, and retrieving them requires a waiting period. Additionally, if a collator fails to perform required functions or acts in bad faith, a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators. If a collators behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to unbond from them or switch to another collator. Delegators can also mitigate risk by electing to distribute their stake across multiple collators._

## How to stake TUR using PolkadotJS

### Step 1: Figure out your inputs
You will need 3 inputs to stake your tokens. These inputs are as follows:
1. Amount
2. Candidate Delegation Count
3. Delegation Count

These numbers are dynamic and will change with additional delegators. Please check these inputs every time before staking more tokens. In this step, there are 2 options below to find these inputs. You can either use Javascript or read the chain state on the UI.

#### Option 1: Find Inputs Via Javascript
To be stake your delegator via PolakdotJS extrinsics, you'll need to figure out three numbers. We've provided a helpful script for you to use. Navigate to the **Developer > Javascript** tab on the [PolkadotJS App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.turing.oak.tech#/js). 

Delete the content of the white box, copy and paste the script below, then replace `COLLATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS` with the correct addresses.

```javascript
const collatorWalletAddress = "COLLATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS";
const delegatorWalletAddress = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS";
const minDelegationStake = await api.consts.parachainStaking.minDelegation;
const candidateInfo = await api.query.parachainStaking.candidateInfo(
  collatorWalletAddress
);
const candidateDelegationCount = JSON.parse(candidateInfo).delegationCount;
const delegatorState = await api.query.parachainStaking.delegatorState(
  delegatorWalletAddress
);
const delegationsLength = (delegatorState.toJSON() !== null && delegatorState.toJSON().delegations)
  ? delegatorState.toJSON().delegations.length
  : 0;
console.log(`2a. Minimum Amount to be staked: ${minDelegationStake}`);
console.log(`2b. Candidate Delegation Count: ${candidateDelegationCount}`);
console.log(`2c. Delegation Count: ${delegationsLength}`);
```

#### Option 2: Find Inputs Via Polkadot JS UI
##### Minimum Amount
![minDelegation](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/minDelegation.png)
This should show the number that represents the minimum amount that can be inputted into the `amount` field on the `parachainStaking.delegate` call in Step 3. Your input for `amount` must be larger than or equal to this number.

1. Go Developer > Chain State > Constants in order to reach the page
2. For the query, use the left drop down on the page to select `parachainStaking` first. This should allow you to select `minDelegation` from the right drop down.
3. Press the circular `+` button on the right of the drop downs in order to execute your query.

##### Candidate Delegation Count
![candidateInfo](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/candidateInfo.png)
This contains information about the collator candidate. Under the field `delegationCount` from the result of the query, you can find the number you need for the `candidateDelegationCount` field on the `parachainStaking.delegate` call in the Step 3. Remember to save this number. Each time another delegator delegates funds to a given collator, this number increases by 1 for that specific collator.

1. Go Developer > Chain State > Storage in order to reach the page
2. For the query, use the left drop down on the page to select `parachainStaking` first. This should allow you to select `candidateInfo` from the right drop down.
3. In the field below that says `AccountId32`, please insert the wallet address of the collator you want to stake with.
4. Press the circular `+` button on the right of the drop downs in order to execute your query.

##### Delegation Count
![minDelegation](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/delegatorState.png)
This contains information about the delegator state. The field `delegations` should be a list. Count the number of items in this list, with each item defined by a set of brackets containing an owner and an amount. In the picture above, it consists of 2 items. Remember to save this number for the `delegationCount` field on the `parachainStaking.delegate` call in the Step 3. Each time you delegate to another collator, this number increases by 1. 

1. Go Developer > Chain State > Storage in order to reach the page
2. For the query, use the left drop down on the page to select `parachainStaking` first. This should allow you to select `delegatorState` from the right drop down.
3. In the field below that says `AccountId32`, please insert your wallet address where you have your TUR tokens for staking.
4. Press the circular `+` button on the right of the drop downs in order to execute your query.

### Step 2: Stake your tokens to a collator

Currently, everything related to staking needs to be accessed via the Extrinsics menu, under the Developer tab. To delegate a candidate, provide the following information:

![delegate](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/delegate.png)

- `candidate`: This will be the collator you so choose to stake towards from your research in Step 1 and has the same `COLLATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS` from Step 2 above.
- `amount`: Figure out how much you would like to stake to the collator. At minimum you must stake `2a. Minimum Amount to be staked` from the output above. Please note, in order to determine how much TUR to stake, you must multiply the number of TUR you want to stake by 10,000,000,000. In other words, take the number of TUR you want to stake and add 10 zeros behind it. Please be sure to type the correct number of zeros, as it could result in significantly more or less TUR than intended being staked.
- `candidateDelegationCount`: Values ​​are available from section above as `2b. Candidate Delegation Count`. Each time another delegator delegates funds to a given collator, this number increases by 1 for that specific collator.
- `delegationCount`: Values ​​are available from the section above as `2c. Delegation Count`. Each time you delegate to another collator, this number increases by 1. 

## How to unstake TUR using PolkadotJS

The unstaking process involves two essential steps.

1. Initiate the unstaking process by submitting a `parachainStaking.scheduleRevokeDelegation` extrinsic to schedule the revocation of delegation.

    ![scheduleRevokeDelegation](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/schedule-revoke-delegation.jpg)

    - `collator`: Specify the collator you wish to unstake.

    The delegator will be scheduled for revocation from the specified collator. The delegator continues to earn rewards until the completion of the `RevokeDelegationDelay`, which is set at 24 rounds (approximately 48 hours) on the Turing Network.

2. After the `RevokeDelegationDelay` period, the delegator must execute a second call, `parachainStaking.executeDelegationRequest`.

    ![executeDelegationRequest](../../assets/img/staking-delegation/execute-delegation-request.jpg)

    - `delegator`: Your staking wallet.
    - `candidate`: Specify the collator you wish to unstake.

    Upon completion of this step, the unstaking process is immediately finalized, and your staked funds are released, becoming available for transfer within your wallet.

## FAQ

### How do I check how many TUR rewards I’ve received?

Search for your wallet on the [Turing Subscan](https://turing.subscan.io/event?address=YOUR_NOMINATOR_WALLET&module=parachainstaking&event=reward) and filter for "reward" events.

### What rewards will I get?

The Turing Network pays 2.5% in annual token inflation to the stakers who back the collators which successfully author blocks. Those rewards are distributed proportionally among the stakers for each collator, including the self-bond of the node operator and up to 300 delegators.

Each block pays the same amount in rewards, so your portion of rewards for authoring each block will be lower when delegating to a collator with a higher total stake (self-bond plus delegated stake) when compared to a collator with a lower total stake.
