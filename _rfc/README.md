## What's an RFC?
At a high-level, an RFC is a document to request feedback and comments from the broader open-source ecosystem. Not all expected changes to the blockchain will undergo this process, as there will be many, many decisions made that are unwieldy to track outside of code. 

The intention of these set of documents is for transparency to and feedback from the broader community, and once implemented in code, the OAK team will codify this literally via code and publish official documentation under the "Docs" tab.

We have also opened up a Discussion tab in this repository to foster discussions. Thank you for your time and happy reading!
